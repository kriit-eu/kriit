# Font Awesome Grading Icon Fix

**Date:** 2025-06-04

## Problem
The blue comment bubble (chatbox) icon was not displaying in the grading table, even though the code and CSS were correct. The browser showed a 404 error for the Font Awesome CSS file:

```
/node_modules/@fortawesome/fontawesome-free/css/all.min.css
```

This happened because the `node_modules` directory is not exposed to the web server in Docker, so static assets like CSS and webfonts could not be loaded by the browser.

## Solution
1. **Copied Font Awesome CSS and webfonts to the public `assets/` directory:**
   - `all.min.css` was copied to `assets/css/`
   - All webfont files were copied to `assets/webfonts/`
2. **Updated font paths in the CSS:**
   - Changed all `../webfonts/` references to `/assets/webfonts/` in `assets/css/all.min.css`.
3. **Updated the HTML to load Font Awesome from the new location:**
   - In `templates/partials/master_header.php`, the link now points to `/assets/css/all.min.css` instead of the file in `node_modules`.

## Result
Font Awesome is now served from a public directory, and the blue comment bubble icon displays correctly in the grading table.

**This is the recommended way to serve third-party static assets in Dockerized PHP/Apache projects.**
